# **Movie Recommendation System**

---------------
## **Context**
---------------

Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repositories. If we can build a **recommendation system** to recommend movies to the users based on **their historical interactions with movies**, this would improve customer satisfaction. Increased customer satisfaction will **increase the revenue of the company**. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies but can be any item for which you can build a recommendation system.

-----------------
## **Objective**
-----------------

Using the above dataset, we will build two different types of recommendation systems that are listed below.
- **Clustering-based recommendation system**.
- **Content-based collaborative filtering**.

-----------------
## **Dataset**
-----------------

We will use the following three datasets for this case study:
- **ratings** dataset - This dataset contains the following attributes:

    - movieId
